# Fool's Gambit - Yet ANOTHER Alternate Balatro Mod
## Balatro, but somethings off...?

> [!WARNING]
> This mod is in an early state! Certain additions may be broken or unbalanced, which may lead to crashes or generally a less fair experience. This is being worked on and will be remedied in the future.

> [!NOTE]

Fool's Gambit is an unused title for Balatro. This mod aims to add (some)new jokers, packs and alternate effects to most Balatro gimmicks, including:
- Alternative effects for ~~all~~ some jokers, tarots and spectrals
- New jokers, aside from the alternate vanilla ones.
- A new consumable type.
- New seal~~s~~.
- Alternate editions.
- ~~An alternate soundtrack and SFX~~ (moved to [Tonsmith](https://github.com/Goldofleaves/Tonsmith)).
## Crossmod
Fool's Gambit also features some additional content when paired with other mods, namely:
### [GIGA](https://github.com/MrYamiTsu/Giga-Balatro_Mod) by **mryamitsu**.
The largest crossmod with Fool's Gambit so far. When pairing Fool's Gambit and Giga, combined they add:
- Even more alternate Jokers.
- Alternate **food** cards.
- Alternate **Upgraded** seals.
- Alternate **upgraded** enhancements.

"You should also check out Giga on its own, it is very neat!" -Jogla, Fool's Gambit Lead Developer
### [JokerDisplay](https://github.com/nh6574/JokerDisplay) by **nh6574**.
Fool's Gambit has Joker display on alternate jokers, as well as its own new Jokers.
